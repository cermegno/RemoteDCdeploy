### This is not working at the moment. I'd like to test if the folder exists before attempting to copy
### The alternative is to have an empty directory otherwise the copy fails
#- stat:
#    path: "source_folders/{{ group_names[0] }}"
#  register: folder
  
#- debug:
#    msg: "{{ folder }}"
#    msg: "Path exists and is a directory"
#  when: folder.stat.isdir is defined and folder.stat.isdir
